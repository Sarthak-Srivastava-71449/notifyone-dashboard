It is legally not permitted<br>2. Sometimes, there is a valid reason why your doctor may have suggested a particular brand, and it may be important to be aware of that. There are often reasons like pill size, easy availability, trust on the quality of the manufacturing company etc that lead to a doctor genuinely suggesting a specific brand. Many times, doctors may be neutral between top trusted brands, but are not comfortable with unknown manufacturers whether they are actually fully compliant with respect to the quality.<br><br>We suggest you check with your doctor if in your case, the chosen alternate brand is ok for you.
